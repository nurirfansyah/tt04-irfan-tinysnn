# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      this architecture will have input of angle, and input of k cordic factor(0.6) and output of sinus. it will compute based on codic alghoritm. there is some 
      state like IDLE, SIGMANEGADDER, ADDER, SHIFT. sigmanegadder is for sigma = -1(based on cordic this is will happen if theta is more than input angle)
      and adder when sigma = -1. SHIFT is shifting based on iter. Because the more iteration the more of shifting need.

      
      
      
      
      

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Make sure the reset is goes from 0 to 1, and put ui_in with 60 in binary and input angle(0~90) to uio_in, after that if want another angle, just configure
      reset goes from 0 to 1 again, you can check my testbench verilog file
